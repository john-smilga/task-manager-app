## Development Choices/Technology Stack

### React

For this project, I selected React due to its component-based architecture and efficient reactivity system. This choice enabled me to add more features faster and streamline the development process. Nevertheless, I'm still comfortable and proficient in building similar applications with just Vanilla JS, ensuring a strong foundation in the fundamentals of JavaScript.

### TypeScript

In this project, I utilized TypeScript because it provided strong typing and compile-time error checking. This enhanced the code's reliability and maintainability.

### CSS

For this project, I chose vanilla CSS to showcase my familiarity and skill with CSS fundamentals. Additionally, I am adept and well-versed in using Tailwind CSS for utility-centric strategies.

### Redux Toolkit

In this project, I opted for Redux Toolkit due to its longer-standing presence in the industry. However, at this point, a library like Zustand would be a suitable alternative.
